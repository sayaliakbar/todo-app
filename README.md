# todo-app
This repository contains my solution to Frontend Mentor's "Todo App" challenge. The app enables users to manage tasks with features like adding, completing, deleting, and reordering via drag-and-drop. It includes filters for task status, a light/dark mode toggle, and ensures responsiveness across devices.
